# contact_book
Final Project for 1st Year

My Project: Contact Book Application.
This project is a simple contact book application written in Python and uses CSV file storage.
Contacts can contain names, phone numbers, email addresses, and addresses.
Its features allow users to view all of the contacts, search for a specific contact, add a contact, delete a contact, and update a contact in main.py, which calls the functions in core_logic.py.
The project includes unit tests for the validity of the input in test_core_logic.py to ensure the functions work correctly.
